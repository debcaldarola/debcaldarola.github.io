I am a 3rd-year **PhD student** in the [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/units/turin) [VANDAL](http://vandal.polito.it/) lab at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/), Italy. I am supervised by [Professor Barbara Caputo](http://vandal.polito.it/index.php/people/barbaracaputo/) and advised by [Dr. Marco Ciccone](https://marcociccone.github.io). 

My research focuses on **Federated Learning** (FL) and the development of algorithms to handle data distributions shifts across clients, with a specific interest in computer vision tasks. 

I received my Master's and Bachelor's degree in **Computer Engineering** from Politecnico di Torino with maximum grade, completing them in 2020 and 2018 respectively. It was during my Master's thesis titled *Towards Real World Federated Learning* that I gained my initial hands-on experience with FL. Under the guidance of Prof. Barbara Caputo (Politecnico di Torino), Prof. Fabio Galasso (Sapienza University of Rome) and Dr. Massimiliano Mancini (University of TÃ¼bingen), we modeled the interactions among groups of similar clients through a graph-based approach.

I am a proud member and past President of the [Mu Nu Chapter](https://hknpolito.org/) of **IEEE Eta Kappa Nu**, the honor society of IEEE.

Soon to be Visiting Student Researcher at **Stanford University** under the guidance of [Prof. Sanmi Koyejo](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/sanmi/)!
