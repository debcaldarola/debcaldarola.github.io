I am a 3rd-year **PhD student** in the [VANDAL](http://vandal.polito.it/) lab at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/), Italy. I am supervised by [Professor Barbara Caputo](http://vandal.polito.it/index.php/people/barbaracaputo/) and advised by [Dr. Marco Ciccone](https://marcociccone.github.io). 

My research focuses on **Federated Learning** (FL) and the development of algorithms to handle data distributions shifts across clients, with a specific interest in computer vision tasks. 

I received my Master's and Bachelor's degree in **Computer Engineering** from Politecnico di Torino with maximum grade, completing them in 2020 and 2018 respectively. It was during my Master's thesis titled *Towards Real World Federated Learning* that I gained my initial hands-on experience with FL. Under the guidance of Prof. Barbara Caputo (Politecnico di Torino), Prof. Fabio Galasso (Sapienza University of Rome) and Dr. Massimiliano Mancini (University of Tübingen), we modeled the interactions among groups of similar clients through a graph-based approach.

I am a proud member and past President of the [Mu Nu Chapter](https://hknpolito.org/) of **IEEE Eta Kappa Nu**, the honor society of IEEE.

Soon to be Visiting Student Researcher at **Stanford University** under the guidance of [Prof. Sanmi Koyejo](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/sanmi/)!
