I received my Master's and Bachelor's degree in <b>Computer Engineering</b> from Politecnico di Torino with maximum grade, completing them in 2020 and 2018 respectively. It was during my Master's thesis titled <i>Towards Real World Federated Learning</i> that I gained my initial hands-on experience with FL. Under the guidance of Prof. Barbara Caputo (Politecnico di Torino), Prof. Fabio Galasso (Sapienza University of Rome) and Dr. Massimiliano Mancini (University of TÃ¼bingen), we modeled the interactions among groups of similar clients through a graph-based approach.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize numerous domains, but concerns regarding <b><i>fairness</i></b> and <b><i>responsibility</i></b> have emerged as critical considerations. Developing AI algorithms that are fair, accountable, and socially responsible is imperative for mitigating biases and ensuring equitable outcomes. In my current research, I focus on leveraging <b>Federated Learning</b> (FL) as a powerful paradigm to reach such goals. FL aims to learn a global model from disparate users' data, while respecting the privacy regulations in force. Looking at realistic scenarios, my main efforts aim to
<ul style="font-size:medium">
    <li> Learn models providing <b>fair predictions</b> to the entire data distribution, <i>e.g.</i>, not biased towards some less represented demographic groups.</li>
    <li> Broaden the horizons of applicability of FL to <b>real-life vision tasks</b>, such as autonomous driving, or image geo-localization, while introducing realistic constraints, <i>e.g.</i>, the absence of labeled data.</li>
</ul>
