<p style="font-size:medium">
I am a 3rd-year <b>PhD student</b> in the <a href="https://ellis.eu/units/turin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ELLIS</a> <a href="http://vandal.polito.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VANDAL</a> lab at <a href="https://www.polito.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Politecnico di Torino</a>, Italy. I am supervised by <a href="http://vandal.polito.it/index.php/people/barbaracaputo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Professor Barbara Caputo</a> and advised by <a href="https://marcociccone.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Marco Ciccone</a>. 
<br><br>
My research focuses on <b>Federated Learning</b> (FL) and the development of algorithms to handle data distributions shifts across clients, with a specific interest in computer vision tasks. 
<br><br>
I received my Master's and Bachelor's degree in <b>Computer Engineering</b> from Politecnico di Torino with maximum grade, completing them in 2020 and 2018 respectively. It was during my Master's thesis titled <i>Towards Real World Federated Learning</i> that I gained my initial hands-on experience with FL. Under the guidance of Prof. Barbara Caputo (Politecnico di Torino), Prof. Fabio Galasso (Sapienza University of Rome) and Dr. Massimiliano Mancini (University of TÃ¼bingen), we modeled the interactions among groups of similar clients through a graph-based approach.
<br><br>
I am a proud member and past President of the <a href="https://hknpolito.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mu Nu Chapter</a> of <b>IEEE Eta Kappa Nu</b>, the honor society of IEEE.
<br><br>
Soon to be Visiting Student Researcher at <b>Stanford University</b> under the guidance of <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/sanmi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Sanmi Koyejo</a>!
