    I recently earned my PhD in Computer Engineering from <a href="https://www.polito.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polytechnic of Turin</a> (Italy) ðŸŽ‰!<br> 
    Over the past four years, I've been part of the <a href="https://ellis.eu/units/turin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ELLIS</a> <a href="http://vandal.polito.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VANDAL</a> lab, working under the guidance of <a href="http://vandal.polito.it/index.php/people/barbaracaputo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Barbara Caputo</a> and <a href="https://marcociccone.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Marco Ciccone</a>. I spent part of my last year in the <b>STAIR (Stanford Trustworthy AI Research)</b> group at <b>Stanford University</b>, advised by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/sanmi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Sanmi Koyejo</a>.

My work focuses on <b>trustworthy machine learning</b>, with a specific focus on <b>Federated Learning</b> (FL) and <b>fairness</b>, studied through the lens of the loss landscape and applied to computer vision tasks.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize numerous domains, but concerns regarding <b><i>fairness</i></b> and <b><i>responsibility</i></b> have emerged as critical considerations. Developing AI algorithms that are fair, accountable, and socially responsible is imperative for mitigating biases and ensuring equitable outcomes. In my current research, I focus on leveraging <b>Federated Learning</b> (FL) as a powerful paradigm to reach such goals. FL aims to learn a global model from disparate users' data, while respecting the privacy regulations in force. Looking at realistic scenarios, my main efforts aim to
<ul style="font-size:medium">
    <li> Learn models providing <b>fair predictions</b> to the entire data distribution, <i>e.g.</i>, not biased towards some less represented demographic groups.</li>
    <li> Broaden the horizons of applicability of FL to <b>real-life vision tasks</b>, such as autonomous driving, or image geo-localization, while introducing realistic constraints, <i>e.g.</i>, the absence of labeled data.</li>
</ul>
